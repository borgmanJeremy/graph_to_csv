# Goal
The end goal for this repo is to have a good way to export datasheet graphs to csv.

## Details
main.py contains a simple example based on [this](https://vovkos.github.io/doxyrest-showcase/opencv/sphinx_rtd_theme/page_tutorial_moprh_lines_detection.html). I'm not entirely happy with the results but its a starting point.


## More Ideas
- Support log / linear x and y scales
- support tweaking filter with slider bars to support datasheet images with different line sizes
- Support cropping
- Highlight multiple curves in different highlighter colors to support multi export.
- Port to c++ (openCV + QT) once prototype is working
